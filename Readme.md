This is a simple example of how simple it can be to use SQLite and DataStar to build applications. 

## How to run

go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest (or use other approaches at https://templ.guide/quick-start/installation)

go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest  (or other approaches at go install https://github.com/air-verse/air?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
